It will track many things. Eventually. In Blender.

Oh, and pose-estimate as well

## Updates:

* 20/11/2021 - Added **pre-release** version, tested for **Blender 2.9.2** only

## Installation notes
* As we are using **tensorflow 2.7**, in order to run inference on your GPU, you will need to install [CUDA 11.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exelocal) and [cudNN 8.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive). Refer to [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) official guide for version matching and installation instructions.
* When installing the **OmniTrax** package, you may need to run **Blender** in **admnistrator mode** (on **Windows**). Otherwise, the additional required python packages may not be installable.
